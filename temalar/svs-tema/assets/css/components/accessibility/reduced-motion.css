/**
 * Reduced Motion Accessibility Styles
 *
 * This file contains CSS overrides for users who have enabled "prefers-reduced-motion"
 * in their operating system settings. This is a critical accessibility feature for
 * users with vestibular disorders, motion sensitivity, or other conditions that
 * can be triggered by animations and motion effects.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: The !important declarations are REQUIRED here because:
 * 1. Accessibility overrides must take precedence over decorative animations
 * 2. The universal selector (*) needs to override existing CSS with varying specificity
 * 3. Users with motion sensitivity rely on these overrides working reliably
 * 4. Theme components may have animations defined with different specificity levels
 *
 * These overrides ensure that all animations, transitions, and motion effects
 * are either disabled or reduced to their minimum duration for affected users.
